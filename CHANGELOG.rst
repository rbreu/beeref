0.3.2 - (unreleased)
====================

Added
-----

* For arranging, a gap between images can now be configured in the
  settings.
* The opacity of images can be changed (Images -> Change Opacity).
* Images can be set to display as grayscale (Images -> Grayscale).


Fixed
-----

* Scene Export: Fix output image size and margins when scene had been
  scaled or moved.
* Scene Export: Selecting filename without file extension now
  automatically appends the extension from the selected filter istead
  of resulting in a confusing error message.
* The exemption from antialias/smoothing for images displayed at large
  zoom now also works on images that are flipped horizontally


Changed
-------

* Improved performance of Select All/Deselect All



0.3.1 - 2023-12-10
==================

Added
-----

* Images can now be stored JPG or PNG inside the bee file. By default,
  small images and images with an alpha channel will be stored as PNG,
  the rest as JPG. In the newly created settings dialog, this
  behaviour can be changed to always use PNG (the former behaviour) or
  always JPG. To apply this behaviour to already saved images in
  existing bee files, you can save them as new files.
* Enabled antialiasing/smoothing. Images that are being displayed at a
  large zoom factor are exempt to make sure that icons, pixel sprites
  etc can be viewed correctly.
* A scene can now be exported to a single image (File -> Export Scene...)
* Alternative way to move the BeeRef window without the title bar:
  View -> Move Window (or press "M")


Changed
-------

* Editing of text items will now be undoable after leaving edit mode
* Empty text items will be deleted after leaving edit mode
* Text edit mode can now be aborted with Escape
* "Save as" will now open pre-select the folder of the currently opened file
* "Save" and "Save as" are now inactive when the scene is empty


Fixed
-----

* Fixed a bug where the binary data of deleted images would still hang
  around in the bee file.
* The shortcut to move the BeeRef window (Ctrl + Alt + Drag)
  now works on an empty scene
* Crash when copying an item from a bee file, opening a new scene and
  pasting the image into it.

* Remember window geometry when closing (by David Andrs)

Fixed
-----

* Various typos (by luzpaz)
* Ensure that small items always have an area in the middle for
  moving/editing that doesn't trigger transform actions
* Ensure that the first click to select an item doesn't immediately trigger
  transform actions
