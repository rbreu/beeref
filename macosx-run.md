## How to run on Mac OS X

When you open the `BeeRef.app` bundle, and you see the following error, keep reading.

</center>

The following steps will walk you though the process that will allow you to run BeeRef:

* Click **OK** to close the above error
* Click on the Apple logo in the menu bar and select **System preferences...**
* Go to **Security & Privacy** tab and select the **General** tab
* Now you should see the text as shown on the image below:

    <img src="{{ site.baseurl}}/assets/images/macosx-open-from-sys-prefs.png" alt="Allow from system preferences" width="570"/>
  </center>

* Click **Open Anyway**
* Go back to the location where you have `BeeRef.app` and double click it to run it again.
* You will be greeted by the warning shown below:

  <center>
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl}}/assets/images/macosx-open-anyway.png" alt="Open anyway" width="251"/>
  </center>

* Click **Open** and `BeeRef` should run

Luckily, you have to do this only once.
